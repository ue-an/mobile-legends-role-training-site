                <h3 style="color: rgb(0, 160, 157);">Background</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Mobile Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) for iOS and Android devices developed and published by Shanghai Moonton Technology, a game development company based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The game was launched in 2016.</p>
                <h3 class="ability-name">Gameplay</h3>
                <br>
                <p>At its core, Mobile Legends pits 2 teams of 5 against each other, with the main objective being to destroy the opponent’s base.</p>
                <p>At the start of the game, each player gets to select a hero. Each hero has a unique set of attributes and skills. There are currently 92 heroes in the game, grouped into 6 different roles: tank, fighter, assassin, marksman, support, and mage.</p>
                <p>These roles determine the responsibilities of players for their respective teams. Support heroes, for instance, can buff or heal their teammates. That’s why they should stick with their allies to keep them alive or strong in battle.</p>
                <p>Players must also level their heroes up by defeating enemy forces, specifically computer-controlled minions, turrets, and heroes. Doing so earns them in-game money, which they can spend on items that boost the stats of their heroes.</p>
                <p>A typical game of Mobile Legends runs an average of 10 to 15 minutes, unlike MOBA titles for PC like Dota 2 and League of Legends, which can last anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour.</p>

                <br>
                <h3 class="headings">Roles</h3>
                <br>
                <h3 class="ability-name">Tank</h3>
                <p>Tanks are durable, front-line champions that help lock down enemies and start fights. They're usually found leading the charge, choosing the right times and situations to initiate aggression. Many tanks can also protect their more fragile teammates by stunning or pushing around dangerous foes and limiting their damage potential. In mobile legends, most classes of heroes are really versatile in terms of abilities and with the item crafting variations a "tank" can be played as a DPS if you choose the right equipment. Usually, tanks are laning on the bottom tower. Tank has high defense and hit point, but low damage. Their high durability usually be used to pin the enemy in the center of the battlefield.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="ability-name">Fighter</h3>
                <p>Fighters are close range combatants that possess a mix of offensive and defensive capabilities. While they don't have as much utility as a tank or as much damage as an assassin, a fighter's damage will add up over time to make it a major threat. Each fighter has a unique blend of mobility, damage, disruption and durability. Fighter is an intermediate melee heroes, between Tank durability or Assassin damage, hence make fighter serve as multi purpose combatant, such as Semi Tank, Crowd Controller, or Tank and Assassin.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="ability-name">Marksman</h3>
                <p>Marksman is a type of role that has a high attack/damage and critical and distance. This type is commonly referred to as carry/ADC [Attack Damage Carry]. Marksman plays an important role in the game by defeating enemies from a distance. When using this hero, be smart to keep the distance with the hero of the opponent, because this type of hero usually has low durability and mobility in the early game. Marksman heroes always rely on Tanks. When using this type of hero, you should use gears that increase your attack speed, because in addition to kill the enemy, Marksman can also destroy the tower quickly.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="ability-name">Mage</h3>
                <p>A magician, (commonly known as Mage in most MOBA games) is a magic damage dealer and an important role in any team composition. Their strengths are in their abilities and not usually their basic attacks. They, however, tend to be squishy and are a priority target in team fights due to their burst damage and crowd control abilities.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="ability-name">Assassin</h3>
                <p>An assassin is an agile champion that specializes in killing or disabling roaming targets picking them of as they try to replenish HP. Focused on infiltration, deception, and mobility, assassins are opportunistic hunters who find favorable moments within a fight before jumping into the fray. Regardless of the size of the enemy team, assassins specializes in positioning and artful killing. They strike when the time is right – no sooner, no later. Assassins are more suitable to be played by experienced players as they have low HP and high burst damage. They are ideal for taking out opponents easily, but are easier to be killed due to bad positioning and wrong timing.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="ability-name">Support</h3>
                <p>The Support role is to aid and help protect your allies in any situation. Your role is is to shield or heal them, to tanking some damage or sacrificing yourself to keep others alive. You are often giving up the glorious kills in the game to support others, but in the end its usually the support to secure the true MVP award. Support heroes usually lane with the marksman in top lane or at mid lane in order to be able to travel quickly where they are needed.</p>

                <h3 class="headings">Tips</h3>
                <br>
                <p>A tank is a type of role that has high HP and high defense while having a very low attack. This position is always at the front by acting as a shield against enemies, taking the damage. With their durability, they're very good for dividing the enemy formation and allowing the damage dealers to poke the opponents while you absorbing damage for them, thus they are really useful in assisting teammates.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A fighter is a type of role that has a combination of characteristics of a Tank and an Assassin. They can act as a semi-tank and a damage dealer because of their durability and damage. This role is versatile depending on the team lineup. They're sometimes used in soloing a lane or in accompanying an ally. They usually shine during the late game.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Marksman is a type of role that has a high basic attack, dealing damage in a distance. This type is commonly referred to as carry/ADC [Attack Damage Carry]. This role usually has low durability and mobility, thus playing safe is recommended by keeping your distance from your enemies or by being accompanied by allies. Most marksmen deal damage through basic attacks so, they can take down turrets quickly. They shine during the late game.</p>
